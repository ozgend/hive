<h1>BioAPI Reference Implementation: Using</h1>

Now that you've got your framework installed, and the password BSP and
sample app running, you will want to develop your own BSP or
application.  The examples provided should give you a pretty good idea
of how to proceed, but we'll point out some of the important points
here.

<h2>Applications</h2>

The sample app project (<a href="apps/sample/win32/">/apps/sample/win32/</a>)
is a good place to start.  The main things that an application needs to
do are:

<ol>

<li>Include the bioapi.h file.  This includes all other important header
files required for most applications.  Every application will require
this.

<li>Include the bioapi_schema.h file.  This defines the BSP schema
structures and the BioAPI_EnumModules function, required for querying
the MDS.  Almost every application will require this.

<li>Define a set of application memory functions, according to the
definitions in bioapi_type.h.  These functions will be used by the BSPs
to allocate memory from the application heap, rather than their own
internal heaps.  Alternately, if you have no special memory
requirements, you may be able to use the default functions defined in
bioapi_util.h, and provided in the bioapi_util.lib static link library.

<li>Implement the calls into the BioAPI framework required by your
application.

<li>It is expected that most applications will want to link with the
bioapi100.lib stub library, which will allow applications to
automatically link dynamically with the framework.  It is also possible
for an application to load the framework dynamically for itself, and
functions will be added to the bioapi_util static link library to make
this easier.

</ol>

<h2>BSPs</h2>

A BSP has somewhat more stringent requirements than an application.  BSP
developers should review section 4.2 of the specification for details.

<p>The dummy addin project
(<a href="addins/bioapi_dummy_addin/">/addins/bioapi_dummy_addin/</a>)
is a good place to start.  The main things are:

<ol>

<li>Include the biospi.h file.  This includes all other important header
files required for most BSPs.  Every BSP will require this.

<li>Copy the maf_config.h file from the sample addin and modify to
insert the BSP-specific options.

<li>Write an installation function.  This is often managed by simply
copying, and possibly slightly modifying, the install.c file from the
sample addin.

<li>Define and implement the interface to be provided by the BSP.
bioapi_dummy_addini.c contains a skeleton implementation of all
available SPI functions.  A particular BSP may implement as many or as
few of these functions as desired, subject to the requirements laid out
in section 4.2 of the specification.

<li>Copy mod_manage.c from the dummy addin and make any required
changes.

<li>It is expected that most BSPs will want to link with the
bioapi_util.lib static link library.

</ol>
