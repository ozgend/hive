<h1>BioAPI Reference Implementation: Readme</h1>

Welcome to the BioAPI Reference Implementation, version 1.0beta1.  This
is the first public release of the reference implementation.

<p>By this time, you should already have read and agreed to the terms
set out in the license agreement, located in
<a href="00_License.htm">00_License.htm</a>.  If not, do so now.

<p>The next step is to review what comes in this package.  The file
<a href="09_Manifest.htm">09_Manifest.htm</a> should help you through
this process.

<p>Once you have seen the array of source before you, you will be glad to
know that there is a simple process for building all of it.  The file
<a href="10_Build.htm">10_Build.htm</a> has details that will walk you
through it.

<p>The file <a href="11_Install.htm">11_Install.htm</a> will be your
next stop, as you will undoubtedly want to install your binaries and
give them a test run.

<p>Now that you've got everything installed, you'll want to start doing
something useful with it.  This is where <a href="12_Use.htm">12_Use.htm</a>
comes in.  Whether you are developing a BSP or an application, this file
has the info you need to get started.

<p>If you are like us, you want the BioAPI framework to be as rock-solid as
possible.  Since it is open source, you have an opportunity to
contribute to this goal.  Please browse <a href="20_Todo.htm">20_Todo.htm</a>
for the list of current issues, and what you can do to help resolve
them.

<p>To review the history of the reference implementation, check in
<a href="30_History.htm">30_History.htm</a>.

<p>A list of those who have made this possible is in
<a href="31_Contributors.htm">31_Contributors.htm</a>.

<p>We'd love to hear from you, whether you have success stories, problems
you need resolved, or questions about how things work.  To find out how
to get in touch with us, or for instructions on how to sign up to one of
our mailing lists, see <a href="32_Contacts.htm">32_Contacts.htm</a>.

<p>It is expected that all of these files will grow and become more useful
as time goes by, and questions are asked and answered.

<p>Thanks, and enjoy!
