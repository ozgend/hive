<h1>BioAPI Reference Implementation: Manifest</h1>

The following isn't really a true manifest of everything included in the
package.  Rather, it is more of a roadmap picking out the main tourist
locations.

<p><a href="addins/bioapi_dummy_addin/">/addins/bioapi_dummy_addin/</a>
<br>The BioAPI dummy addin (BSP).  This is essentially a skeleton
implementing all BSP functions (from which real BSPs may be derived),
and can also be used for framework testing.

<p><a href="addins/dl/">/addins/dl/</a>
<br>Data library, used by the MDS to provide a platform-independent
information registry.

<p><a href="addins/dl/mds/">/addins/dl/mds/</a>
<br>Module Directory Schema

<p><a href="addins/dl/mds/mds_install/">/addins/dl/mds/mds_install/</a>
<br>Application to install the MDS.

<p><a href="addins/maf/">/addins/maf/</a>
<br>MAF is an acronym that Intel can't decide what for.  The parts we use
are common to all BSPs, but generally need to be compiled individually,
and can't go into a common library.

<p><a href="addins/pwbsp/">/addins/pwbsp/</a>
<br>An example BSP based on passwords.  This is currently included only as a
BSP example, and as a simple "no hardware required" test for checking
framework builds.

<p><a href="apps/CMDS/">/apps/CMDS/</a>
<br>A library used by MdsEdit.

<p><a href="apps/MdsEdit/">/apps/MdsEdit/</a>
<br>A regedit-like interface for manipulating the MDS.

<p><a href="apps/mod_install/">/apps/mod_install/</a>
<br>An application used to install all modules, including the framework and
BSPs.  See 11_Install.txt for usage instructions.

<p><a href="apps/Sample/">/apps/Sample/</a>
<br>A sample application which demonstrates the basic operations of MDS
query, module loading/unloading and attaching/detaching, enrollment and
verification.  Verification demonstrates how to use the MDS to determine
available options.

<p><a href="build/">/build/</a>
<br>Contains a workspace for performing the entire build, batch files for
installing and uninstalling, and a repository where all binaries are
copied after compilation.

<p><a href="framework/bioapi_util/">/framework/bioapi_util/</a>
<br>A library of functions generally useful in a number of places both
within the BioAPI reference implementation and for all BSPs.

<p><a href="framework/h_layer/">/framework/h_layer/</a>
<br>The fundamental framework that ties applications to BSPs.

<p><a href="framework/mds_util/">/framework/mds_util/</a>
<br><a href="framework/mds_util_api/">/framework/mds_util_api/</a>
<br>Utilities used in the framework to interface to the MDS.  Of little or
no interest to BSP and application developers.

<p><a href="imports/">/imports/</a>
<br>Source and libraries imported directly from the Intel CDSA, generally
dealing with MDS and porting issues.

<p><a href="include/">/include/</a>
<br>All general (not project-specific) BioAPI header files.
