<h1>BioAPI Reference Implementation: Building</h1>

The reference implementation was developed under Microsoft Visual
Studio, and workspaces and projects are included for building all the
various projects.

<p>The easiest way to go about it is to load the /build/build.dsw
workspace, set "build" as the active project, and build it.  This will
ensure that all projects in the system are compiled.

<p>There are three configurations: debug, memdebug and release.  Debug and
release are exactly what you would expect.  Memdebug is the same as
debug, but defines BioAPI_MEMCHECK_ON, which tells files to use enhanced
versions of memory functions (malloc, free, realloc, calloc) which are
intended to track memory allocations and give a report of any memory
leaks, and where they were allocated from.
