<h1>BioAPI Reference Implementation: Contributors</h1>

The following companies and individuals have made this possible:

<p>First, of course, are the many talented individuals who have so ably
represented their respective companies at the BioAPI Consortium
meetings, leading up to the pulication of the specification, without
whom we wouldn't have had anything to implement a reference of.

<p><a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a>'s Open Source
<a href="http://developer.intel.com/ial/security/">CDSA/HRS</a>
framework provided the original structure, and indeed much of this code
is essentially unchanged from that time.  David Bowler from Intel
provided significant development assistance and patiently answered many
questions, without which this would have taken much longer and been of
much lower quality.

<p><a href="http://www.mytec.com/">Mytec Technologies Inc.</a> hosted
the first development workshop.  Colin Soutar is the chair of the
reference implementation.  Greg Schmidt was lead developer, maintainer
of the source control system, debugger of MDS and the framework, and
wrote these works of lasting literary value that you are currently
enjoying.  We appreciate Mytec's commitment of resources to this
project.

<p><a href="http://www.saflink.com/">SAFLINK</a> hosted the second
development workshop, and contributed much of Tim Brown's time to the
development process.  Tim was responsible for the sample application,
among other things.

<p><a href="http://www.iriscan.com/">Iriscan</a> contributed the time of
Garrett Deacon, whose most visible responsibility was handling the
various schemas, including the MDSEdit utility.

<p>Tomoko Onaka of Visionics, Harry Trautmann of Softpro, and Roy Myers of
Ankari contributed detailed bug reports and usually patches to fix the
bugs.

<p>Please contribute to the project so that your name too may be recorded
for all time in this hallowed location.
